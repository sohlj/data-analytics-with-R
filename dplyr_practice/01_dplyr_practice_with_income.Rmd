Dataset: incomedata.csv

### Importing dataset & library

```{r include=FALSE}
# Import libraries
library(dplyr)

# Import dataset
setwd(".")
df <- read.csv(file="./incomedata.csv", header=TRUE)

```


Checking dataset
```{r}
# Preview
head(df)

# Check datatype
str(df)

# Check unique values
table(df$agecat)
table(df$educ)
table(df$gender)
```


### Practice 1
Select the variables age category (agecat) and gender for the subjects who did not complete high school

```{r}
df1 <- df %>%
  filter( educ == 'Did not complete high school') %>%
  select('agecat', 'gender', 'educ')

head(df1)
```


### Practice 2
Select the variables age category and gender for the subjects who did not complete high school and have the income greater than 20

```{r}
df2 <- df %>%
  filter(educ=='Did not complete high school', income>20) %>%
  select('agecat', 'gender')

head(df2)

```


### Practice 3
Select the male subjects with the income lower than 65 and compute their average income

```{r}
(average_income <- df %>%
  filter(gender=='Male', income<65) %>%
  summarise(avginc=mean(income)))

```


### Practice 4
Group the subjects by age category and compute the mean and the standard deviation of the income

```{r}
(df4 <- df %>%
  group_by(agecat) %>%
  summarise(avgincome=mean(income), stdincome=sd(income)))

```


### Practice 5
Sort the data frame by income, in ascending and descending order
```{r}
# Sort ascending
head(arrange(df, income))

# Sort descending
head(arrange(df, desc(income)))
```


### Practice 6
Count the number of subjects in each education category
```{r}
count(df, educ)
```


### Practice 7
Select 150 subjects at random, with and without replacement
```{r}
# With replacement
slice_sample(df, n = 100, replace = TRUE)

# Without replacement
slice_sample(df, n = 100, replace = FALSE)
```


### Practice 8
Select 25% of the subjects at random, with and without replacement
```{r}
# With replacement
slice_sample(df, prop = 0.5, replace = TRUE)

# Without replacement
slice_sample(df, prop = 0.5, replace = FALSE)
```
